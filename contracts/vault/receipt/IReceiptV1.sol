/// provide an interface to allow an owner to UNILATERALLY (e.g. without access
/// or allowance restrictions):
///
/// - mint
/// - burn
/// - transfer
/// - emit data
///
/// The owner MUST implement `IReceiptOwnerV1` to authorize transfers and receipt
/// information. The `IReceiptV1` MUST call the relevant authorization function
/// on the owner for receipt information and standard ERC1155 transfers.
///
/// Earlier versions of `ReceiptVault` implemented the vault as BOTH an ERC1155
/// AND ERC20/4626 vault, which technically worked fine onchain but offchain
/// tooling such as MetaMask seems to only understand a contract implementing one
/// token interface. The combination of `IReceiptV1` and `IReceiptOwnerV1`
/// attempts to emulate the hybrid token model through paired interfaces.
