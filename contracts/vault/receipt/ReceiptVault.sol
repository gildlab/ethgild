///
/// - Implementing an ERC4626 standard vault with assets and shares
/// - where the shares are minted 1:1 with an ERC1155 receipt NFT across many IDs
/// - and each ID is associated with a specific deposit event
/// - that records arbitrary offchain data for decentralised commentary per-ID
/// - such that shares can be freely treated as standard onchain fungible assets
/// - and can be burned at any time, but only 1:1 with their creation event
/// - by forcing the burner to hold and burn both a receipt and some shares for
///   every burn.
///
/// The specifics of share/asset ratios on mints/burns, additional authorization
/// logic, transfer restrictions, etc. are all extensible and overridable through
/// inheritance and standard Open Zeppelin hooks from the underlying contracts.
///
/// Note that the receipt implementation is a separate contract as we found
/// during development that combining ERC20 and ERC1155 on a single contract
/// resulted in poor tooling/wallet support offchain (e.g. MetaMask).
/// Conceptually it is reasonable to consider the minted shares and receipts as
/// a single unit, forming a singular hybrid token model.
///
/// Note also that neither the receipt nor the shares are intended to represent
/// "ownership", whatever that means in your local legal/cultural bubble. The
/// receipt merely represents a right (or perhaps even responsibility) to burn
/// shares, and the shares only represent an expectation that assets associated
/// with the shares' mint event DO NOT MOVE (whatever that means) until/unless
/// those shares are burned.
///
/// Each vault is deployed from a factory as a clone from a reference
/// implementation, allowing for the model to cheaply and freedomly scale
/// horizontally. This allows for some trust/permissioned concessions to be made
/// per-vault as new competing vaults can always be deployed and traded against
/// each other in parallel, allowing trust to be "policed" at the liquidity and
/// free market layer.
