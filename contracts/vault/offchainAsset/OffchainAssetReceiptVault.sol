/// maintain a peg between offchain and onchain markets.
///
/// At a high level this works because the custodian can always profitably trade
/// the peg against offchain markets in both directions.
///
/// Price is higher onchain: Custodian can buy/produce assets offchain and mint
/// tokens then sell the tokens for more than the assets would sell for offchain
/// thus making a profit. The sale of the tokens brings the onchain price down.
/// Price is higher offchain: Custodian can sell assets offchain and
/// buyback+burn tokens onchain for less than the offchain sale, thus making a
/// profit. The token purchase brings the onchain price up.
///
/// In contrast to pure algorithmic tokens and sentiment based stablecoins, a
/// competent custodian can profit "infinitely" to maintain the peg no matter
/// how badly the peg breaks. As long as every token is fully collateralised by
/// liquid offchain assets, tokens can be profitably bought and burned by the
/// custodian all the way to 0 token supply.
///
/// This model is contingent on existing onchain and offchain liquidity
/// and the custodian being competent. These requirements are non-trivial. There
/// are far more incompetent and malicious custodians than competent ones. Only
/// so many bars of gold can fit in a vault, and only so many trees that can
/// live in a forest.
///
/// This contract does not attempt to solve for liquidity and trustworthyness,
/// it only seeks to provide baseline functionality that a competent custodian
/// will need to tackle the problem. The implementation provides:
///
/// - `ReceiptVault` base that allows transparent onchain/offchain audit history
/// - Certifier role that allows for audits of offchain assets that can fail
/// - KYC/membership lists that can restrict who can hold/transfer assets as
///   any Rain `ITierV2` interface
/// - Ability to comply with sanctions/regulators by confiscating assets
/// - `ERC20` shares in the vault that can be traded minted/burned to track a peg
/// - `ERC4626` compliant vault interface (inherited from `ReceiptVault`)
/// - Fine grained standard Open Zeppelin access control for all system roles
/// - Snapshots from `ReceiptVault` exposed under a role to ease potential
